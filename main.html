	 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm. It describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run in relation to the size of its input. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, which means they can process large inputs quickly.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity, on the other hand, is a measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm requires in relation to its input size. It is often represented using the notation <b>O(n)</b>, where 'n' is the size of the input. Space complexity helps us understand how much memory an algorithm needs to perform its task effectively.</p>
